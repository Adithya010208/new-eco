# EcoBuild (Phase 2: The Collaborative Maker Network)

## Deployment and current build experience

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for GitHub → Vercel deployment, Firebase configuration and direct-route support. The repository includes the polished 3D Studio, a compact model/guide layout, optional English voice narration and curated build references. Use Node.js 24 and `npm ci` for reproducible installs.

**EcoBuild** helps people turn unused, salvaged, and spare electronic components into useful, working projects.

In **Phase 2**, EcoBuild expands from single-user workbench inventory matching into a **Collaborative Maker Network**, answering the question:
> *“Who can help me finish this project?”*

---

## 🚀 What's New in Phase 2

1. **Explainable Project-Partner Suggestions**:
   - Project-specific candidate discovery comparing exact catalog components.
   - Evaluates active user's baseline coverage and candidate's shareable free working inventory.
   - Computes potential combined coverage and coverage improvement boost (e.g., `+50%`).
   - Identifies complementary skills (e.g. Mechanical assembly, Sensor testing) and shared project interests.
   - Plain-language explanations (e.g., *"Elena offers 2× TT DC Motor and 1× L298N Driver, boosting coverage by +50%"*).

2. **Role Switching with 6 Demo Maker Profiles**:
   - Compact demo user switcher in top bar with active identity and pending request notifications.
   - **Adithya** (Primary user; Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, servos, breadboard, resistors).
   - **Elena Rostova** (Actuator & Motor specialist; TT gear motors, L298N H-Bridge driver).
   - **Marcus Chen** (Telemetry & environmental builder; DHT11 sensor, I2C OLED display, soil moisture probe, ESP32).
   - **Priya Patel** (Beginner enthusiast; Piezo buzzers, tactile push buttons, LEDs).
   - **Dr. Robert Vance** (Opted-in Mentor; Senior lab advisor for circuit debugging and brownout isolation).
   - **Amina Diallo** (Opted-in Mentor; Embedded firmware specialist for non-blocking timers and I2C protocols).
   - Switching demo profiles preserves partitioned inventories, distinct proposal inboxes, and workspace permissions.

3. **Collaboration Proposals & Inventory Reservations**:
   - Send structured proposals detailing proposed sender contributions, receiver contributions, remaining deficits, and member responsibilities.
   - **Non-destructive sending**: Sending a proposal does **not** reserve stock prematurely.
   - **Pre-acceptance rechecking**: Accepting re-verifies live free stock, conditions, and collaboration sharing for both parties.
   - **Reservation integration**: Upon acceptance, agreed parts are actively reserved, decrementing free stock for other projects while the active workspace retains full requirement coverage.
   - **Cancellation & Release**: Cancelling releases all reserved parts back to free usable stock.

4. **Dedicated Project Workspaces (`/workspaces/:id`)**:
   - Virtual project collaboration rooms for accepted teams.
   - **Overview**: Combined coverage bar counting workspace reservations, member roles, high-level build steps.
   - **Components**: Transparent hardware contribution table with reservation status and component passport previews.
   - **Tasks**: Interactive Kanban task board (To Do, In Progress, Done) with assignee and status advancement.
   - **Discussion**: Safe team message feed with authorship and timestamps.
   - **Mentorship**: Linked mentorship questions directly accessible from the workspace.
   - **Permissions guard**: Non-members view the room in observer mode; only team members can add tasks or post messages.
   - **3D Build Simulator**: Clearly tagged as Phase 3 architecture preview.

5. **Opted-In Mentor Discovery & Structured Requests**:
   - Directory of verified mentors with declared skills, supported help topics, and availability preferences.
   - Structured help tickets covering circuit understanding, troubleshooting, programming, component testing, and assembly.
   - Mentors can reply with diagnostic advice; requesters can mark tickets resolved.

6. **Sharing & Privacy Controls**:
   - Explicit `Available for Maker Network Collaboration` toggle on every inventory item.
   - Private, reserved, installed, faulty, unsafe, or untested components are strictly excluded from candidate offers.

7. **Versioned Storage Migration (v1 → v2)**:
   - Preserves existing Phase 1 user inventory, profile preferences, and saved projects.
   - Automatically migrates Adithya's existing components to `maker-adithya` with `ownerId` and sharing flags.

## 📖 Walkthrough: Complete Collaboration Lifecycle

Here is how to test the end-to-end collaborative flow in the prototype:

1. **Step 1 (Discover & Select Project)**:
   - Start as **Adithya** (active demo user in top bar).
   - Go to **Project Library** or **Discover** and open the **Autonomous Obstacle-Avoidance Rover** (`/projects/proj-obstacle-robot`).
   - Notice individual coverage is 50% (missing 2× DC gear motors and 1× L298N driver).

2. **Step 2 (Find a Partner)**:
   - Click **Find a Partner for this Build** at the bottom of the page (or open **Maker Network** → **Project Partners**).
   - Notice **Elena Rostova** is suggested with a **+50% coverage boost** (100% combined coverage!), offering 2× TT DC Motors and 1× L298N Driver.
   - Click **Propose Collaboration**, review contributions, and click **Send Proposal**.

3. **Step 3 (Role Switch & Acceptance)**:
   - Open the **Demo User Switcher** in the top bar and select **Elena Rostova**.
   - Notice the pending badge indicates a new incoming proposal.
   - Go to **Maker Network** → **My Activity**.
   - Inspect Adithya's proposal for the Obstacle Rover and click **Accept & Reserve Parts**.
   - The workspace `ws-rover-...` is created, and Elena's motors and Adithya's board are safely reserved.

4. **Step 4 (Workspace Tasks & Discussion)**:
   - Click **Go to Project Workspace** (or access it from **My Activity**).
   - Review the **100% Reserved Coverage** bar.
   - Go to **Tasks**, click **Add Task**, assign a task to Adithya, and advance Elena's motor test task to **Done**.
   - Go to **Discussion** and post an update as Elena.

5. **Step 5 (Ask a Mentor & Answer)**:
   - In the workspace (or on the Obstacle Rover page), click **Ask a Mentor**.
   - Select **Dr. Robert Vance**, ask about motor electrical noise decoupling, and submit.
   - Switch demo role to **Dr. Robert Vance** in the top bar.
   - Go to **Maker Network** → **My Activity** → **Mentorship Tickets**, type advice, and click **Reply**.
   - Switch back to **Adithya** to see Dr. Vance's guidance and click **Mark Question as Resolved**.

## Troubleshooting chat

Open the speech-bubble button beside the EcoBuild logo. The built-in assistant matches common symptoms, offers numbered checks, provides unresolved-issue follow-ups, and links to project guides and reference documentation. It works in Demo Mode without an API key and does not change platform data. It is rule-based guidance, not a live AI model. English/Tamil/Hindi controls and topic buttons are supported; technical answers and free-text keyword matching currently use English. Conversations stay in page memory and are cleared on reload.
